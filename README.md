# Optimization-Models

This repository contains a set of python code for implementation of Linear Programming methods for "toy" optimization problems such as facility location, transport planning, lecture assignments to students, vortex colouring etc.
These problems are modelled using Linear Programming and solved using the Gurobi Solver.
These were carried out as part of the curriculum in RWTH Aachen Business School.
